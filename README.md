# Bamazon

A store inventory application running on node. This application functions from the view of the customer and provides a list of available products and then allows the user to choose a product for purchase and then asks for the quantity of the product they would like to purchase.

### Examples

### Initial View
Initial view of our program presenting a list of products and querying the user if they would like to purchase an available product and how much of that product they would like to buy.

### Purchasing and persistent database
View of our database after a few purchases have been made. It updates both the money generated by sales and the amount of stock left.
